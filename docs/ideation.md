The Smart STEM Weather Station is an interactive educational tool designed to engage K-12 students in learning about meteorology, environmental science, and data analysis. This web-enabled physical device provides real-time environmental data and encourages students to explore STEM concepts through hands-on interaction and intuitive design. The weather station emphasizes energy efficiency, modularity, and user-friendly features to align with educational standards and inspire curiosity in young learners.

Core Functionalities (Sensors):
The system integrates four key sensors to provide comprehensive environmental monitoring:

1. Temperature & Humidity Sensor (DHT22/BME280)
    a. Measures atmospheric temperature and humidity.
    b.Provides real-time data for tracking weather trends and indoor/outdoor climate conditions.

2. Air Pressure Sensor (BMP280/MPL3115A2)

    a. Tracks atmospheric pressure changes to help predict weather patterns.
    b. Useful for understanding high and low-pressure systems.

3. Wind Speed Sensor (Anemometer)
    a. Measures wind velocity and direction to analyze weather trends.
    b. Provides insights into wind patterns and their impact on daily weather.

4. Air Quality Sensor (BME680/MQ-135)
    a. Detects pollutants such as CO2, VOCs, and particulate matter.
    b. Helps students understand environmental health and pollution levels.

The Smart STEM Weather Station is an innovative and engaging educational tool that brings real-world weather monitoring into the classroom. By combining real-time data collection, interactive learning, and cloud-based connectivity, it provides students with an immersive STEM experience. Designed with durability, accessibility, and ease of use in mind, this weather station aims to inspire curiosity and enhance learning opportunities for students of all ages.
