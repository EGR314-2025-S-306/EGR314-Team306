## Team Charter

Charter Statement:

Our mission is to design and deliver innovative, sustainable, and modular embedded systems that address educational and STEM-based challenges. This semester, we aim to develop an interactive, web-enabled physical device demonstrating a scientific or engineering concept. The project will prioritize modularity, standards compliance, and user engagement to support K-12 students' interest in STEM fields. Success will be measured by the device's interactivity, educational impact, technical robustness, and adherence to modular design principles.

Mission Statement:

 Our goal is to develop an interactive, STEM-themed educational display within four months that engages K-12 students by showcasing a scientific or engineering concept in a fun and intuitive way. The product will emphasize energy efficiency, modularity, and user-friendly design, ensuring both technical excellence and alignment with educational standards. We aim to deliver a sustainable, impactful solution that inspires young learners to explore science, technology, engineering, and mathematics while fostering our team’s growth in professional engineering practices.
