***Project Summary:***
> The MacroChip team‚Äôs Smart STEM Weather Station is an interactive, web-enabled weather monitoring system designed to engage K-12 students in hands-on learning. This exhibit collects real-time environmental data (such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and air pressure) and displays it on an intuitive Human-Machine Interface (HMI). A solar panel on the station actively tracks sunlight to demonstrate renewable energy principles, while an onboard Wi-Fi module publishes the weather data to an online dashboard for remote viewing. The device emphasizes accessibility, modular design, and educational value, allowing visitors to navigate through different weather metrics using a simple keypad and to see live data both on the local display and via the internet
By combining sensor technology, interactive controls, and cloud connectivity, the MacroChip Weather Station transforms abstract environmental science concepts into tangible, engaging experiences for learners of all ages.

## Team Organization & Charter

#### Mission Statement

> Our mission: Design and deliver an interactive, STEM-themed educational weather station that inspires K-12 students to explore science and engineering. We aim to showcase real-time weather data through an intuitive HMI, emphasizing energy efficiency, modularity, and ease of use, while aligning with educational standards.
This project will engage young learners by making environmental science tangible and fun, turning complex concepts into an accessible hands-on exhibit.

#### Team Charter & Values

Our team operates on core principles of collaboration, innovation, professionalism, and educational impact. 
Each member is accountable for their subsystem while supporting seamless integration across the project. We prioritize creative problem-solving and adhere to engineering best practices, ensuring the design is well-documented and robust. As a team, we commit to:

- **Effective Collaboration:** Maintain open communication, assist each other, and integrate our subsystems into a cohesive product.

- **Modular Design:** Build the system in interchangeable modules (sensing, actuation, interface, connectivity) to enhance scalability and maintainability.

- **Quality and Sustainability:** Use industry standards and reliable components to create a durable exhibit that can run safely for extended periods.

- **Educational Focus:** Keep the end-user (students and visitors) in mind, providing an intuitive, engaging experience that aligns with classroom learning objectives.

- **Accountability:** Meet project deadlines, stay within budget, and document progress. Each member takes ownership of their part while understanding the overall system.
